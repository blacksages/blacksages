# Welcome to Benoît's Data Science World!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm Benoît, a passionate data science student in my final year at ULiège. I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself and what I'm up to in the world of data and beyond!
## About Me

I'm a curious soul with a knack for unraveling insights from data. Whether it's crunching numbers, building models, or diving into the world of machine learning, I'm always eager to explore and learn new things. My journey in data science has been nothing short of exciting, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.
## Interests

Aside from my love for data, I have a few other passions that keep me busy:
### 🎹 Piano

Music is a big part of my life, and you can often find me tinkling the ivories on my piano. It's my go-to way to unwind and express myself creatively.
### 📚 Reading Webtoons and Manga

When I'm not buried in datasets, you'll likely find me lost in the colorful worlds of webtoons and manga. There's something magical about immersing myself in captivating stories and stunning artwork.
### 🔍 Discovering New Things

Whether it's exploring a new hiking trail, trying out a new recipe, or delving into a fascinating topic online, I'm always on the lookout for new experiences and knowledge. Life's too short to stick to the familiar, right?
